# methylation_pattern_modelling_pub

This repository contains the implementation of our basic models (without multiple generations) using the Gillepsie's algorithm, as well as extensions of this considering 1. No linkage and 2. Recombination takes place.
Further, we have also conducted a data fitting using non-linear least squares method to fit the averaged methylation level over multiple runs of our simulated data to a function that best describes the dynamics of this. Last but not least, this repository provides the codes to our cluster size and mSFS analysis.
